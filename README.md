## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – to create the basic structure
- **CSS3** – for design and layout
- **JavaScript** – to update the clock in real-time



## 🧠 How It Works
- The clock is updated every second using JavaScript’s `setInterval()`.
- Time is fetched using the built-in `Date` object.
- Leading zeros are added for single-digit numbers using conditional formatting or `padStart()`.
